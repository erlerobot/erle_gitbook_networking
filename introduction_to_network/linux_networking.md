## Linux networking

To go into the next chapters, you should have a basic knowledge of Linux/Unix.
If not,we recommend yout to read first a [Uix introduction tutorial](http://erlerobotics.gitbooks.io/erle_gitbook_unixintroduction/).

As you have seen modern networking applications require a sophisticated approach to carrying data from one machine to another.The solution that Unix systems, and subsequently many nonâˆ’Unix systems, have adopted is known as TCP/IP. When talking about TCP/IP networks you will hear the term datagram, which technically has a special meaning but is often used interchangeably with packet.

As you know, Linux itself is just a kernel. Linux can be configured as a networked workstation, a DNS server, a DHCP server, a web server, a mail server, a file and print server, database server, a firewall, a gateway router and many more.Linux is capable to be all that. In this section, you will learn the odds of **Linux as a network operating system or server system**, to be all that mention above.
